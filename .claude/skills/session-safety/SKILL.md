# session-safety

Prevents Claude Code sessions from silently overwriting each other's work. Always active.

---

## Session Start (mandatory, before any work)

### 1. Read CLAUDE.md

If the repo has a CLAUDE.md, read it FIRST. It contains session history, known issues,
and explicit "do not repeat" instructions. Do not skip this.

### 2. Check for uncommitted changes

```bash
git status
git stash list
```
If uncommitted changes exist: list them, ask "Stash, commit, or work around them?"
Never silently proceed.

### 3. Note recent commits

```bash
git log --oneline -5
```
Flag overlap if the last commit was from a different session and touched relevant files.

### 4. Groundhog Day scan (BLOCKING)

```bash
git branch -a --sort=-committerdate | head -30
```

If branches with similar commit messages exist (e.g., multiple "skill audit," "consolidate,"
"improve code-builder" branches):

```
SESSION BLOCKED: Groundhog Day detected.

{N} branches already attempted this exact task:
- {branch}: {commit message} ({date})
- {branch}: {commit message} ({date})

This work has been done. Do NOT start over.

Options:
1. Read the most recent branch and EDIT its files (don't rewrite)
2. Ask Hannah what specifically needs to change
3. Focus on merging existing work rather than creating more

Proceeding without addressing this will waste another session.
```

**This is blocking.** Do not proceed with a task that duplicates existing branch work
unless Hannah explicitly confirms "yes, start fresh."

---

## Before Modifying Files

1. Check if the file has uncommitted changes. Warn before overwriting.
2. Never delete a file without checking `git log` for it first.
3. Never remove a component/function/import added in a recent commit unless the task explicitly requires it.

---

## Conflict Recovery

If work was lost ("that was deleted", "where did X go"):

1. `git reflog` → find the commit where it existed
2. `git show {sha}:{path}` → recover file content
3. Cherry-pick or manual restore
4. Commit with message: `restore: {description} (deleted by prior session)`

---

## Sandbox-Scoped Sessions (Claude Code on the Web)

Web sessions are scope-locked to a single repo. When changes need to go to another repo:

1. Write changes as full file contents under `.claude/skills/` or a clear path in the current repo.
2. Include exact laptop commands in CLAUDE.md under "Laptop Instructions":
   ```bash
   cd ~/path/to/target-repo
   cp ~/hbschlac/.claude/skills/X/SKILL.md ./SKILL.md
   git commit -am "description" && git push
   ```
3. Do not assume "Hannah will figure it out." Be explicit.

---

## Anti-Orphan Rules

1. **No standalone AUDIT.md, REVIEW.md, SKILLS-AUDIT.md, or analysis files.** Put findings inline in CLAUDE.md or in the relevant skill file.
2. **No rewriting skills from scratch.** Edit the existing file. If no version exists, create one. If a version exists, modify it.
3. **No redundant consolidation.** If CLAUDE.md says "Last consolidated: [date]", trust it. Make incremental changes.
4. **No version-inflating rewrites.** Don't claim "v7" if you rewrote the file from scratch instead of editing v6. Versions track evolution, not replacement.

---

## Session End Checklist

Before ending a session that created improvements:

- [ ] Changes are committed (not just staged)
- [ ] Branch is pushed to remote
- [ ] If changes target another repo, laptop instructions are in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] CLAUDE.md is updated if project context changed
- [ ] No orphaned analysis files
- [ ] **Tell Hannah to merge.** Work on branches is useless until merged.
